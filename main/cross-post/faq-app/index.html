  <h1>In-App Purchase</h1>
<!-- For each question in the section. -->
<h2>What does the "Unlock Everything" In-App Purchase actual give me?</h2>
<p>Cross Post is free, but it has limits. You can post to only one social media site at a time using the free version. You can remove this limitation by purchasing the "Unlock Everything" In-App Purchase item. After making the purchase you can send your post to more than one social media site at the same time.</p>
<h2>Why have the In-App Purchase?</h2>
<p>The In-App Purchase is provided so you can try the app out for free. It's fully functional with one exception. You can send your post to one social media site at a time. This means if you want to send the same post to Facebook and Twitter, then you must send the post twice, once for each social media site. But if you purchase the "Unlock Everything" In-App Purchase item, then this limitation is removed and you can send your post to more than one social media site at the same time.</p>
<h2>Is the In-App Purchase a recurring charge or a one time charge?</h2>
<p>It is a one time charge. You never have to pay for the app again once you purchase the "Unlock Everything" item.</p>
<h2>I purchased "Unlock Everything". Do I have to purchase it again for each device I own?</h2>
<p>First of all thank you for your purchase. It is much appreciated. Now back to the question, no, you do not have to purchase "Unlocked Everything" on each device. You only need to purchase it once, then restore your purchase on each additional device. You can accomplish this by tapping "Restore Purchases" in the Settings screen.</p>
<h1>Share Extension</h1>
<!-- For each question in the section. -->
<h2>Why do I get the message, "You must authorize Cross Post with Facebook/Twitter/App.net to send your status update"?</h2>

  <li>Follow the online screen instructions to grant Cross Post permission to use your account.</li>
</ol>
<h2>I keep getting the message, "You must authorize Cross Post with Facebook to send your status update" even though I've authorized Cross Post to use my account.</h2>
<p>If you continue to see this message even after authorizing Cross Post, force Cross Post to close and launch it again. You do not need to re-authorize your account. The share extension should now see that you have authorized the social media site.</p>
